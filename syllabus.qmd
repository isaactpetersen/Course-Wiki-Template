# Academic Honesty and Misconduct {#sec-academicHonesty}

All students in CLAS courses are expected to abide by the [college's standards of academic honesty](https://clas.uiowa.edu/students/handbook/academic-fraud-honor-code).
<mark>[FOR UNDERGRADUATE COURSES:] </mark>Academic misconduct must be reported by instructors to CLAS according to [these procedures](https://policy.clas.uiowa.edu/clas-policies-and-procedures/undergraduate-education/academic-misconduct-undergraduate).
<mark>[FOR GRADUATE COURSES:] </mark>Academic misconduct must be reported to the Graduate College according to Section F of the [Graduate College Manual](https://grad.uiowa.edu/academics/manual/academic-program/section-iv-academic-standing-probation-and-dismissal).

Please note that collaboration with other classmates on <u>INSERT</u> is not permitted.
However, I do encourage you to collaborate with classmates on <u>INSERT</u>.
In addition, you are expected to follow the course's policy on the use of artificial intelligence (AI), which is outlined below.

# Artificial Intelligence (AI) Policy {#sec-ai}

Because writing, analytical, and critical thinking skills are part of the learning outcomes of this course, all work submitted by students should be prepared by the student.
You are training these cognitive muscles; if you go to the gym, you would not have AI lift the weights for you.
For these reasons, AI-generated submissions are not permitted and will be treated as plagiarism.
Learning these core foundational skills will make you a better user of AI in the future, because you will be better-positioned in the future to critically evaluate AI responses and to identify when (and the ways in which) its responses are inaccurate.
Moreover, in many industries, use of AI is not permitted because you cannot share the company's proprietary information.
Thus, developing strong competencies in these domains (without the use of AI) will prepare you for a competitive workplace.

### Missing Exams {#sec-missingExams}

[University regulations require that students be allowed to make up examinations](https://opsmanual.uiowa.edu/students/absences-class) that have been missed due to illness, religious holy days, military service obligations (including service-related medical appointments), or other unavoidable circumstances or University-sponsored activities.
Students with UI-authorized activities must discuss their absences with the instructor as soon as possible.
Religious obligations must be communicated within the first three weeks of classes.
See below for the documentation necessary for an absence to be excused and to be eligible to take a make-up exam.

Students are allowed to make up exams that have been missed due to illness, mandatory religious observations, official University activities, or other unavoidable circumstances.
Note: the format of the make-up exam may differ from the original exam.
If you know that you must be away at the time of an exam for one of these reasons, Professor Petersen <mark>or the TA</mark> must be contacted in advance whenever possible to schedule a make-up exam.
In order to take a make-up exam, you must provide acceptable documentation to be eligible to take it: including documentation for any report of illness; any other circumstances must be documented by the University of Iowa [Absence Explanation Form](https://clas.uiowa.edu/sites/clas.uiowa.edu/files/2024-05/ABSENCE%20EXPLANATION%20FORM.pdf) (located in ICON under "Student Tools") and must be approved by Professor Petersen.
<u>In sum, to be eligible for a make-up exam, Professor Petersen <mark>or the TA</mark> must be contacted before the examination whenever possible, and you must send acceptable form of documentation to Professor Petersen <mark>or the TA</mark></u>.

# Grading System and the Use of +/- {#sec-gradingSystem}

The [final examination date and time](https://registrar.uiowa.edu/final-exam-schedules) will be announced by the Registrar generally by the fifth week of classes, and it will be announced on the course ICON site once it is known.
<u>Do not plan your end of the semester travel plans until the final exam schedule is made public.
It is your responsibility to know the date, time, and place of the final exam.</u>
According to the Registrar's final exam policy, students <u>have a maximum of two weeks after the announced final exam schedule</u> to request a change if an exam conflict exists or if a student has more than two exams scheduled for the same day (see the [policy](https://registrar.uiowa.edu/makeup-final-examination-policies) here).

## Student Complaints {#sec-complaints}

Students with a complaint about a grade or a related matter should first discuss the situation with the instructor, and finally with the DEO (Chair) of the department, school, or program offering the course.
Sometimes students will be referred to the department or program's Director of Undergraduate Studies (DUS) or Director of Graduate Studies (DGS).
<mark>[FOR UNDERGRADUATE COURSES:] </mark>Students should contact [CLAS Undergraduate Programs](https://clas.uiowa.edu/students/handbook/student-rights-responsibilities#rights) for support when the matter is not resolved at the previous level.
<mark>[FOR GRADUATE COURSES:] </mark>Students should contact the [CLAS Graduate Affairs Manager](mailto:Erika-christiansen@uiowa.edu) when additional support is needed.

# Communication: UI Email {#sec-email}

Students are responsible for all official correspondences sent to their UI email address (uiowa.edu) and must use this address for any communication with instructors or staff in the UI community.
For the privacy and the protection of student records, UI faculty and staff can only correspond with UI email addresses.

# Other Expectations of Student Performance {#sec-otherExpectations}

Students have the right to a distraction-free learning environment.
You have the responsibility to help create such a classroom environment.
Please treat other students in the class<mark>, the TAs,</mark> and the instructor with respect.
Students are expected to help each other learn and to contribute overall to the learning environment of the course.
Arriving prepared for class is part of this expectation.

# University Policies {#sec-UIowaPolicies}

[University Policies](https://provost.uiowa.edu/student-course-policies)

[Accommodations for Students with Disabilities](https://provost.uiowa.edu/student-course-policies)\
The University is committed to providing an educational experience that is accessible to all students.
If a student has a diagnosed disability or other disabling condition that may impact the student's ability to complete the course requirements as stated in the syllabus, the student may seek accommodations through [Student Disability Services](https://sds.studentlife.uiowa.edu/students) (SDS).
SDS is responsible for making [Letters of Accommodation (LOA)](https://sds.studentlife.uiowa.edu/students/letter-accommodations-loa) available to the student.
<u>The student must provide a LOA to the instructor as early in the semester as possible, but requests not made at least two weeks prior to the scheduled activity for which an accommodation is sought may not be accommodated.</u>
The LOA will specify what reasonable course accommodations the student is eligible for and those the instructor should provide.
Additional information can be found on the [SDS website](https://sds.studentlife.uiowa.edu/students/apply).

[Class Recordings](https://provost.uiowa.edu/student-course-policies)\
Students may be enrolled in a class where some sessions will be recorded or live-streamed.
Such recordings/streaming will only be available to students registered for the class.
These recordings are the intellectual property of the instructor and they may not be shared or reproduced without the explicit, written consent of the instructor.
Further, students may not share these sessions with those not in the class or upload them to any other online environment.
Doing so would be a breach of the Code of Student Conduct, and, in some cases, a violation of state and federal law, including the Federal Education Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA).

The unauthorized video or audio recording of academic activities (e.g., lectures, course discussions, office hours, etc.) by a student is prohibited.
Students with a reasonable accommodation for recording approved by Student Disability Services should notify each instructor and provide the Letter of Accommodation prior to using the accommodation.
A student may record classroom activities with prior written permission from the instructor and notice to other students in the class that audio or video recording may occur.
Any and all classroom recording must be for personal academic use only.
The distribution, sharing, sale, or posting of recordings on the internet (including social media), in whole or in part, is prohibited and doing so may be a violation of the Code of Student Life and/or state or federal privacy, copyright, or other laws.
