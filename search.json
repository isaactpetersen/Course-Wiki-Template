Students with UI-authorized activities must discuss their absences with the instructor as soon as possible. Religious obligations must be communicated within the first three weeks of classes. See below for the documentation necessary for an absence to be excused and to be eligible to take a make-up exam.\nStudents are allowed to make up exams that have been missed due to illness, mandatory religious observations, official University activities, or other unavoidable circumstances. Note: the format of the make-up exam may differ from the original exam. If you know that you must be away at the time of an exam for one of these reasons, Professor Petersen or the TA must be contacted in advance whenever possible to schedule a make-up exam. In order to take a make-up exam, you must provide acceptable documentation to be eligible to take it: including documentation for any report of illness; any other circumstances must be documented by the University of Iowa Absence Explanation Form (located in ICON under “Student Tools”) and must be approved by Professor Petersen. In sum, to be eligible for a make-up exam, Professor Petersen or the TA must be contacted before the examination whenever possible, and you must send acceptable form of documentation to Professor Petersen or the TA."

The School Readiness Study is a longitudinal study that follows children from 3–7 years of age to better understand how self-regulation and externalizing problems develop, from a bio-psycho-social perspective. In this project, we place special emphasis on the development of neural functioning, as measured by electroencephalography/event-related potentials (EEG/ERP), and how neural development influences the development of children’s self-regulation and externalizing problems. EEG is a method of measuring meaningful differences in children’s self-regulation through ERPs—EEG activity that occurs in response to stimuli—which may be a powerful way of reliably detecting patterns of brain activity that predict behavioral outcomes."
