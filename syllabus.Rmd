[University regulations require that students be allowed to make up examinations](https://opsmanual.uiowa.edu/students/absences-class) that have been missed due to illness, religious holy days, military service obligations (including service-related medical appointments), or other unavoidable circumstances or University-sponsored activities.
Students with UI-authorized activities must discuss their absences with the instructor as soon as possible.
Religious obligations must be communicated within the first three weeks of classes.
See below for the documentation necessary for an absence to be excused and to be eligible to take a make-up exam.

Students are allowed to make up exams that have been missed due to illness, mandatory religious observations, official University activities, or other unavoidable circumstances.
Note: the format of the make-up exam may differ from the original exam.
If you know that you must be away at the time of an exam for one of these reasons, Professor Petersen <mark>or the TA</mark> must be contacted in advance whenever possible to schedule a make-up exam.
In order to take a make-up exam, you must provide acceptable documentation to be eligible to take it: including documentation for any report of illness; any other circumstances must be documented by the University of Iowa [Absence Explanation Form](https://clas.uiowa.edu/faculty/student-attendance-and-absences) and must be approved by Professor Petersen.
